2021:
- Clean-up code for GTK3 and release it.
- Added new function to set the background color of databox: gtk_databox_set_bg_color().
- Added GtkDoc documentation option: ./configure --enable-gtk-doc.
- Removed libglade support, as it's not maintained anymore and depends on GTK2.

From late 2012 ... the push will be to integrate changes for GTK3
